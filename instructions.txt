Language Syntax Guide

1. Classes:
   - King: Represents an integer value with stack operations.
   - Queen: Represents a floating-point value with stack operations.
   - Pawn: Represents a character value with stack operations.
   - Bishop: Represents a string value with stack operations.

2. Operators (Defined within each class):
   - Arithmetic Operators:
     - Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/)
       Supported for King, Queen, and Pawn classes.

   - Logical Operators:
     - Logical AND (&&), Logical OR (||), Logical NOT (!)
       Supported for King, Queen, Pawn classes.

3. CPU Class (Template):
   - Responsible for arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
   - Template supports different data types (int, float, char, string).

4. Template Classes:
   - Register<T>: Holds a value of type T.
   - Cpu<T>: Handles CPU operations for arithmetic and logical operations.

5. Input and Output Operators:
   - Output<T>: Provides custom output functionality for T type objects.
   - Input<T>: Provides custom input functionality for T type objects.

6. Example Usage:
   - King a = 5;
   - King b = 6;
   - King c;
   - King k;

   - c = a + b; // Performs addition using overloaded operator+.
   - std::cout << "Result of addition: " << c.value << std::endl;

   - yourMove yourmove;
   - checkMate checkmate;

   - yourmove && "\nMoving King to A" && c.value; // Custom output using operator&&.

   - yourmove && "\nEnter integer to move King to ";
   - checkmate || k; // Custom input using operator||.
   - yourmove && "\nA " && k.value;

7. Additional Notes:
   - Each class (King, Queen, Pawn, Bishop) implements stack operations with overloaded operators.
   - CPU operations are specialized through the Cpu<T> class using templates for different data types.
   - Operators.h defines custom input and output operators for generic types, enhancing interaction in main programs.

8. File Structure:
   - language.h: Defines classes King, Queen, Pawn, Bishop and includes CPU operations.
   - cpu.h: Defines CPU operations and template classes Register<T> and Cpu<T>.
   - operators.h: Defines custom input and output operators for generic types.

9. Dependencies:
   - Uses C++ standard library components like stack, iostream for input/output operations.
   - Integration with operators.h for streamlined input and output handling in main programs.
